This is simple portfolio site which will showcase a few of my previous apps and will be a continual work in progress.  
The blog, or musings portion, I'm utilizing Evernote as my CMS via Oauth and their API.
My projects portfolio is currently hardcoded in the database but will soon either work with githubs api
or since I'm running a dokku server, my own personal heroku/git server combined, I may have to resort to
scraping my own projects once every few days.  
My interests section will be a personalized (see also: anti-social-clone) of pintrist. I'm just going to export (see also scrape)  
my google chrome bookmarks into a visual folder structure so I can still use my book marks normally but have a place where I can antisocially share.
